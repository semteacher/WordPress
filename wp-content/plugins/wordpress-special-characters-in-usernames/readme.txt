Enables usernames containing special characters (russian, cyrillic, arabic) on your Wordpress Blog.

== Description ==

This plugin enables usernames containing special characters (russian, cyrillic, arabic) on your Wordpress Blog.

Per default Wordpress does not allow to use special characters in usernames. Non-latin characters are 
filtered out and your users cannot create accounts containing cyrillic (russian) or arabic letters.
This plugin is the solution to this problem.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory of your WordPress site,
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress,
